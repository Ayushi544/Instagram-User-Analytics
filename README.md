# Instagram-User-Analytics
An Instagram user analytics project is a data analysis project that focuses on gathering and analyzing data related to a particular Instagram user's account. The goal of such a project is to gain insights into the user's performance on the platform, such as their engagement rate, follower growth, and the effectiveness of their content strategy.

To conduct an Instagram user analytics project, you would typically use tools such as Instagram's API or third-party data providers to gather data on the user's account, including metrics such as the number of followers, likes, comments, and posts. This data would then be cleaned, transformed, and analyzed using SQL or other data analysis tools to identify trends and patterns in the user's performance.

The insights gained from an Instagram user analytics project can be used to inform the user's social media strategy, helping them to optimize their content, engagement, and overall performance on the platform.Here the steps which I did in this project-

Collected data using Instagram's API or third-party data providers.Created the database in MySQL workbench.
